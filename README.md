# Naqi
T5 Capstone Project

Naqi Project
The Naqi project aims to assist the Audiovisual Media Authority in monitoring violators of laws on social media sites. By leveraging AI Naqi filters Saudi content and displays content that violates the authority's guidelines. This approach enhances the monitoring process by making it faster and more efficient.

Features
Content Filtering: The project utilizes pretrained model(Arabert) and LangChain technologies to filter Saudi content in order to identify violations of the Audiovisual Media Authority's guidelines.
Violation Detection: Through the implementation of API, the project detects and highlights content that violates the authority's monitors.
NER (Named Entity Recognition): The project employs NER to extract the name of the company that advertises with a famous person who does not have a license.
License Checking: The project includes a feature to check if the advertiser has the required license to engage in advertising activities.
Efficient Monitoring: By leveraging artificial intelligence, the monitoring process becomes faster and requires less manual effort.

Technology
The Naqi project utilizes several technologies to achieve its goals:

- Arabert (AraBert0.2-Large-Twitter): Arabic language model for natural language processing tasks.
- OCR:  A technology that converts printed or handwritten text into machine-readable text. It is used to digitize documents and automate data entry.
- SpeechRecognition library: A Python package that provides an easy-to-use interface for converting spoken language into written text. It supports multiple speech recognition engines and APIs, various audio sources, and multiple languages. Its main functionality is to recognize speech and convert it into text.
- NLP: Natural Language Processing techniques for text analysis and understanding.
- LangChain: Framework for language-related tasks and processing.
- OpenAI: Artificial intelligence platform for developing and deploying AI models.
- API: Interfaces and endpoints for accessing external services and data sources.
- NER (Named Entity Recognition): Technique for extracting named entities from text.
- License Checking: Integration with relevant databases or systems to verify advertiser licenses.
